# Optimization-of-thermodynamic-performance-metrics-for-heat-Exchanger
A software-based system to optimize thermodynamic metrics of brine-to-fluid heat exchangers. Built with Python, Django, and MySQL, it simulates performance, calculates key metrics like COP and NTU, and applies machine learning for energy-efficient optimization with a web interface.
